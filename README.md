This is puzzle I made during June 2020. It's intended to be a work in progress, so the puzzle may change over time. 
I'm not a web developer, so it's going to take me some time to make version that's more browser friendly.
Feel free to post issues, but don't expect them to be addressed promptly.
If there are issues with the player, it's possible to [download the original mp3](https://soundcloud.com/user-358161767/2451g) and solve the puzzles - but it will be harder.

It's been made with: 

**P5.js (for the interface) [Donate](https://p5js.org/community/)**

**Audacity (for the audio editing) [Donate](https://www.audacityteam.org/donate/)**

**Extensive use of Freesound.com (for various audio samples) [Donate](https://freesound.org/donations/donate/)**

**MP3 hosted by SoundCloud**
